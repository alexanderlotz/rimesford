My point was that we should store as much of our food as we can in the storeroom here at the inn. \nThere’s currently a lot of ale down there, which I argue is not as high priority as storing our frozen produce. It’s one of our few underground storage spaces, which will help keep our food safest. "},{"character":"character-1621975548.json","portrait":"","text":" Skunk has a point, but there’s two problems. First, an inn’s an obvious place to look fer food. If I was an evil ice monster, it’d be the first place I look. Plus, that ale is damn valuable.
